# Questions
This repository contains several question files. Clone the repository to your local environment, open each file, answer the questions, and save. Commit your changes and push back to the remote (GitHub) repository. Group your commits by question type -- i.e. *both math fixes should be in a single commit.*

While you're at it, create a new file that contains a new question.
